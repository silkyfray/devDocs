important files to know
------
typings.json, package.json, tsconfig.json

node (package.json)
------
npm is the node package manager but it is very popular for many different frameworks. 
npm install - searches package.json for dependencies and downloads them into the node_modules folder
package.json is where we specify the package dependencies

typings (typings.json)
-------
tsd is the command line tool for typings. It is now deprecated. Use typings instead
typings is a command line tool for managing the typescript definition files.
"typings install dt~react --global --save" will pull down the definitions d.ts for react and save them inside the typings/global/react folder
it will also create an index.d.ts file which has the typings references used by the project.

tsconfig.json
------
the presence of tsconfig in a folder indicates that it is the root of the typescript project.

properties
-----
better known as props. The things coming from upstream. Readonly

state
-----
mutable. The state and the view are always in sync.

.d.ts
-----
a definition (interface) file.

public vs export
-----
public - does nothing. (All class members are public by default). Legal only inside classes.
export - at file/class/module level. <TODO>
